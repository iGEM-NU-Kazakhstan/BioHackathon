Team Chrispies is happy to announce our **Chrispie Seeker V.0**!

Chrispie Seeker seeks and hides restrictive enzymes in a given DNA


## How to launch
1. `git clone https://github.com/CapYangWenli/Chrispies`
2. `python3 main.py`

## How to use

  There are 2 main ways to input DNA for a Chrispie Seeker:
  
  1) You can change a DNA.txt file in "source/DNA.txt". It is reccomendad way since you have a total control on what is given to the program
  2) You can provide a path to the file with DNA directly in program. When main.py is launched, it asks a path to a DNA file.

 DNA file must only consists of four letters: A, T, G, C!
 
 ## Restrictive Sequences
 
 All Restrictive Sequences are in DNA_res_sam.txt
 
 You can eiither edit the file (don't forget to add a ';' after every sequence) or directly add sequences in program
